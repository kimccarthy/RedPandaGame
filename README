Final Project Review
3D Platformer Speed Runner Game: See how quickly you can navigate the course!

Run with make and ./final 

- Fully textured/detailed world in a cartoonish style complimenting the cartoon panda style
- Nearly all textures are created by hand in Adobe Photoshop to preserve the same cartoony feel. 
- Multiple light sources that are changing location and amount to create a varying light source. Since the scene is set at sunset, meant to give the illusion of changing colors and brightness of light. 
- Movement abilities: Panda not only can walk through the space, but also jump and land on platforms and navigate the course. 
- The jump has conditionals, allowing the panda to both land and fall off platforms 
- Walk cycle: Panda has an animated walk cycle that starts and stops when walking/stopped.
- Timer with minute and seconds elapsed
- There are two view modes: A user camera-control where the panda moves in relation to the current view and an overhead view where the panda only moves in cardinal directions. 


Key bindings:
W: Move away from camera (-z in overhead)
S: Move towards camera (+z in overhead)
D: Move to right of camera (+x in overhead)
A: Move to the left of camera (-x in overhead) 
J = jump
Arrow keys: rotate view

R = Reset panda position and view. 
M = View mode from third person to first person

O = change object  //Used for grading purposes just to get a better view of the walk cycle since it is small in the actual product
(In panda mode, use W/A/S/D to make the panda walk.)
